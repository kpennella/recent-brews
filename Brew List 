Green's Gluten-Free Triple Ale
(Belgian brewer) Green's is gaining traction and audience in the States with their line of gluten-free beers. I have a few 
friends who are gluten-intolerant, so I've tried their whole line, and you'd never know this one was hop/barley/rye free.
Pro-tip: gluten-free does not mean alochol-free!
