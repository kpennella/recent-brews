Recent Noteworthy Beers:

(Seattle) Elysian Wild Mortis:
The wild yeast thing is becoming the new hotness around the PacNW. This one was wheaty version, a bit of sour, low on hoppiness. 

(Portland) Commons Myrtle
Amber color, tart farmhouse ale, mild hoppiness.

(Portland) Breakside Cedarbaumbier
These guys are always mixing it up with unusual brews. Your wool sweaters are safe with this beer.

Green's Gluten-Free Triple Ale
(Belgian brewer) Green's is gaining traction and audience in the States with their line of gluten-free beers. I have a few 
friends who are gluten-intolerant, so I've tried their whole line, and you'd never know this one was hop/barley/rye free.
Pro-tip: gluten-free does not mean alochol-free!

(Portland) Occidental Brewing Dunkelweizen:
Lovely dark, malty brew in the Hefeweizen family making it an enjoyable winter breathern to the lighter Hef's we enjoy
in the warmer weather.

(Oregon) Caldera Rauch Ur Bock:
A dark, sweet, malty beer. The back cherry notes help dispell that "tastes like licking an ashtray" sensation you sometimes
get with rauch beers. 

(Oregon) 10 Barrel Hop Haven Double IPA:
When you absolutely positively need a high octane IPA. Balanced hoppiness with a smooth finish. Dangerously drinkable.
